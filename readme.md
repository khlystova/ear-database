### Database "Magnetic fields and plasma flows during the emergence of active regions in the solar photosphere (1999-2008)"

#### Description

Active regions on the Sun are formed as a result of the magnetic field emergence from the convective zone into the atmosphere. The created database contains parameters of magnetic fields and plasma flows at the stage of development of active regions. The database includes active regions that appeared on the visible side of the Sun in 1999-2008. The selected active regions are isolated from large concentrations of existing magnetic fields and have fairly complete sets of observational data from the SOHO/MDI solar space telescope.

#### Database structure

The database includes 224 emerging active regions. For each active region, the following are given: NOAA number or EFR designation, date and time, heliographic coordinates, parameters of magnetic flux, plasma flows and sunspots in the solar photosphere at different stages of the active region formation. These data are presented as a table and divided into 5 blocks:
1) Data at the beginning of active region emergence;
2) Data at the end of the first hours of active region evolution;
3) Data between the beginning and end of the first hours of active region evolution;
4) Data at the maximum of active region evolution;
5) Data between the beginning and maximum of active region evolution.

The database is stored in formats: h5, csv, and html.

**"h5"** refers to HDF-format, see details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format).
<br>
**"csv"** is a simple text format to store tabular data.
